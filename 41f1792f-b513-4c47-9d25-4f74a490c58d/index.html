<p>Leadership is the exercise of the power to make decisions in the service of an organisation; whatever else the leader does during his or her time in the 'hot seat', the decisions they take will define their leadership term, for good or ill. The organisations they lead and eventually leave behind, are a record of those decisions.  MRL, therefore, focuses on this as a key aspect of leadership for the aspiring leader, and we identify four attributes and four abilities that go to support the decision-making process.</p><h3><a href="null">ATTRIBUTES</a></h3><h3>1. CAPACITY</h3><p>Capacity is the possession, development and deployment of assets in pursuit of an organisational or personal purpose. MRL is designed to develop resilience by enhancing these assets for its participant cohorts. The Programme defines assets in three linked groups; personal, organisational and relational. For example, the greater the depth of financial or human assets an organisation has, the better it can adapt to, and benefit from, changing social, economic, technological and political conditions. Equally, leaders need good personal assets; health, emotional balance, effective relationships, self-knowledge and extensive networks. A deep asset 'bank' supports effective choice making. </p><h3>2. PURPOSE</h3><p>Defining and enacting purpose, both for the individual and his or her organisation, is critical. Segments of the Programme test and develop purpose, covering:</p><ul><li>What? How? Why? Often organisations and individuals are good at describing what they do and how they do it; they sometimes stumble over why? For MRL this is an important underlying question - why are you doing what you're doing? What's your purpose?</li><li>The personal and organisational planning process - using a framework to test and align strategy and tactics with purpose. We use a well developed planning framework drawn from exemplary work in the cultural and commercial sectors. At the end of the Programme participants create a personal strategy plan</li><li>Ethics - how the leader articulates values and creates an ethically consistent narrative links directly to purpose. Having a strong ethical core is essential, especially when a decision involves two evenly balanced alternatives. Acting in alignment with a set of personal and organisational ethics makes the leadership task easier</li><li>Governance - using case studies covering real-world dilemmas in cultural and commercial organisations; to examine purpose under stress. Sometimes a fog of misinformation and personal friction can upset good governance; affect disabling effect</li></ul><p>MRL will help you clarify your own purpose and that of your organisation.</p><h3>3. PRESENCE</h3><p>The personality of the leader always matters; however learning to act in an appropriate and authentic way with a wide variety of audiences and situations is difficult. Some exercises are used to help participants learn to master their 'inner game', with faculty and trainers providing coaching and feedback throughout the Programme.  You will meet leaders with presence and also study those who have failed the 'inner control' challenge. Presence can be enhanced by clarity of purpose and weakened by inner uncertainty. We also look at the difference between presence and charisma.</p><p>MRL offers many opportunities to think about and develop your presence.</p><h3>4. KNOWLEDGE</h3><p>The resilient leader is continuously curious and skilful in applying knowledge acquired to the benefit of their organisation. MRL offers a range of discovery based learning techniques designed to prompt curiosity which is adapted to a wide spread of learning styles. As well as sections which are straightforwardly content rich, e.g. on finance or how to make great presentations, parts of the Programme cover self-knowledge techniques, working with and knowing others in your teams, and horizon expanding. There are specific segments on networks and network mapping, including the use of social media. The Programme specifically highlights the importance of self-knowledge and each participant has a Personal Programme Log, which forms a record of their journey through the MRL year.</p><h3>ABILITIES</h3><h3>5. COMMUNICATING</h3><p>There is a strong emphasis on honing the skills required for effective communication through group and pair work, role play and discussion.  Individual coaching is provided to participants during a workshop and through the Programme-long mentoring support system.  We examine how successful leaders tell good stories, how they shape the narrative.</p><h3>6. DECIDING</h3><p>A leader stands or falls by the decisions they take.  MRL uses a unique online Personal Log system which focuses on decisions taken and asks participants to assess the personal, organisational and relational assets which they brought to bear on their decision.  The Log structure is then used in mentoring sessions to reflect on whether a decision was a good or bad one.</p><h3>7. SEIZING OPPORTUNITIES</h3><p>MRL develops the mindset of the cultural entrepreneur; the capacity to assess risk, act on informed instinct and seize opportunities. </p><h3>8. BUILDING TEAMS</h3><p>The strong leader continuously builds capacity in their teams. The Programme offers models and methods for creating effective teams, often when responding to new challenges.  </p><p>Each year the MRL cohort itself grows and develops as a team, becoming an effective Action Learning Set.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="17"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="18"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="19"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="20"><span data-reactid="21"><!-- react-empty: 22 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="23"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="24"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="25"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="27"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
